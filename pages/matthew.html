		<p class="lead">
			Humans have always wanted to find the most efficient and effective ways
			of doing things, from the basic use of tools to the mass automation
			that started during the industrial revolution.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Computers have greatly improved our ability to automate tasks as well
			allowing us to no longer do dangerous, boring, and monotomous jobs.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mt-3">Boston Dynamics</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			Boston dynamics is an American company that was founded in 1992 which
			develops highly mobile robots.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			One of their most well known products is a four legged canine called
			'Spot' which can be seen below which was released in 2019 however they
			have been prototyping four legged robots since 2005!
		</p>
		<img src="../assets/boston-dynamics-spot.webp" class="w-75 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Example">
		<br>
		<p class="lead">
			With them now working on more advanced robots that are able to completely
			navigate the environment and use the resources that are available to do
			what they need to do. Below is a video of 'Atlas' where you can see him
			demonstrating his capabilities.
		</p>

			<iframe class="rounded embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-e1_QhJ1EhQ?si=4U6na1-5ILWHczyO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<h3 class="mt-3">Self Driving Cars</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			Self driving cars are cars that are able to fully operate without the need
			for any human input. They use numereous sensors to gather infomation about
			the surroundings in order to make judgements and dicisions. These in conjuction
			with map data allow for the vehicle to navigate the roads.
		</p>
		<img src="../assets/Google-self-driving-car-007.jpg" class="w-75 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Example">
		<br>
		
		<p class="lead">
			Currently these are still relatively early in development and there are still
			many concerns with putting self driving cars on the road. With there being lots 
			of ethical considerations to consider, for example the age old trolley problem,
			should a self driving car decide who gets to live and who gets to die? Who then
			should be held accountable? 
		</p>


		<h3 class="mt-3">Why is this all useful?</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			A lot of automation is not only done for convinience, but also for safety.
			For example with self driving cars, automation has the ability to help avoid
			human error which is the biggest cause for car accidents, whether that's because
			someone was distracted while on their phone or under the influence autonomy
			would eliminate this factor making driving a lot safer of a travelling experience.
			On the contrary, it is possible there are bugs and errors and in it's current
			state it would need more development to be widely accepted.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			With the machines that boston dynamics are developing, they aim to be used in
			industries where it is largely unsafe for humans to be, whether that be in large
			factories that work with toxic chemicals or mines that are unsafe for humans to
			traverse, we can instead send a robot to do surveying and act on our behalf instead.
			This allows things to be done without having to risk human lives.
